			<p style = "text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firefly gave me the opportunity to make some of the best memories of my life.  Despite my amazing experience, as a first timer, some things were bound to go wrong.  Here's a list of things I would have told pre-Firefly me to make my first trip to the Woodlands a little less chaotic.</p>
			<p style = "text-align: left; color: purple; margin-bottom: 10px;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BRING RAINBOOTS!!</p>
			<p style = "text-align: left; margin-top: 10px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I could only give one line of advice, that would be it.  If it rains, the festival grounds will get muddy; its inevitable.  Be prepared and don't end up like me: walking around barefoot because my shoes were not strong enough to withstand all that mud.  Even if the forecast does not call for rain, pack them just in case (the weather people are wrong a solid 50% of the time anyway).</p>
			<p style = "text-align: left; color: purple; margin-bottom: 10px;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forget the lunchmeat.</p>
			<p style = "text-align: left; margin-top: 10px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friends and I thought it would be a great idea to bring lunch meat and cheese to firefly to enjoy nice cold cut sandwiches.  What actually happened was all the ice in our cooler melted so our lunch meat and cheese just sat in a cooler full of water for 8 hours while we were in the festival.  In retrospect, peanut butter, jelly, and Nutella were all we actually needed for sandwiches.</p>
			<p style = "text-align: left; color: purple; margin-bottom: 10px;">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practice pitching your tent BEFORE actually going to Firefly.</p>
			<p style = "text-align: left; margin-top: 10px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only did my friends and I have no clue how to pitch a tent, there were 10 people next to us who were festival pros and had their tents up before we even took ours out of the bag.  If you don't practice pitching your tent, you could also pitch it wrong.  There's nothing worse than a tent malfunction and having to sleep in the car for 4 nightsâ€¦</p>
			<p style = "text-align: left; color: purple; margin-bottom: 10px;">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just accept that you're going to be disgusting and move on.</p>
			<p style = "text-align: left; margin-top: 10px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like any girl with a makeup obsession, I planned to do bright and colorful festival makeup all four days.  Festivals always seemed so glamorous, so I never expected how disgusting I would actually feel by the end.  Not having plumbing or running water quickly sucked the motivation to do my makeup right out of me.  Just know, you will be dirty and you will not have the energy to try and look like all the celebrities do at Coachella.  The faster you come to turns with this, the more comfortable your experience will be.</p>
			<p style = "text-align: left; color: purple; margin-bottom: 10px;">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring as many portable chargers as you can, and actually make sure they are charged!</p>
			<p style = "text-align: left; margin-top: 10px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have about 5 portable chargers at my house and only brought one in my rush to pack.  Not only did I forget the other 4 chargers, the one I actually brought was only a quarter charged.  Needless to say, my phone died on the first day and I had to consistently beg everyone to let me borrow theirs to charge my phone for a few minutes.  I really wish I could have stressed the importance of having charged portable chargers to pre-Firefly me.</p>
			<p style = "text-align: left; color: purple; margin-bottom: 10px;">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get all the sleep you can pre-Firefly; you won't be getting much while you're there.</p>
			<p style = "text-align: left; margin-top: 10px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not expect to get a comfortable 8 hours of sleep at Firefly.  Even if you're not up all night, odds are, everyone around you will be and won't care whether or not you're trying to sleep.  Firefly is a time for going crazy and having the best time of your life, so get a lot of sleep before hand so the lack of sleep you'll get in the Woodlands won't impact you post-Firefly too much.</p><br>
			<p style = "text-align: left; margin-top: 10px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well there you have it, 6 things I wish I knew before attending Firefly 2015.  Despite the few complications, I would not trade my experience at Firefly for the world.  Fingers crossed I'll follow my own advice though before leaving for Firefly 2016 this June!</p>

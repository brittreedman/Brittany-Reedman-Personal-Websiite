		<p style="font-size: 4vw; text-align: left;">Here are a few things that make me, me.</p>

			<p class="about" id="link1" style="border-top: 1vw solid #FFBFE9; padding-top: 1vw;">I am constantly trying to better myself, whether that be by improving my coding abilities, learning new programming languages, taking on more responsibility and leadership opportunities, or practicing for hours on the tennis courts.</p>

			<p class="about" id="link2">As I grew older, I naturally grew more and more interested in technology.  My mother was a computer science major so I was reluctant at first to pursue the career path she did.  I soon realized though that there was nothing that could keep me from computer science.  From the second I wrote my first Java program in high school, I knew I discovered what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.</p>
			
			<p class="about" id="link3">I love puzzles.  You will never catch me playing anything but puzzle games on my cell phone.  Minesweeper, Unblock Me, 2048, and Flow are some of my favorites.  My puzzle addiction led me to solve my first rubik's cube.  Once I started, I couldn't stop.  I now advidly enjoy solving 2x2, 3x3, 5x5, and shape shifting cubes.</p>
			
			<p class="about" id="link4">I started playing tennis at 12 years old, which is much later than all other top tennis players.  I used to play basketball, softball, soccer, and recieved two blackbelts in karate.  Once I discovered tennis though, I quit all the other sports I played to focus on becomming a better tennis player.  Now, 7 years later, I have never looked back.  I play first singles for the TCNJ women's tennis team and my freshman year made it to the finals of the International Tennis Association Division III Northeast Regional Champtionship and was named Rookie of the Year by the New Jersey Athletic Conference.</p>
